The advancement of the web is moving at the speed of light. It’s easy to get lost in the sea of frameworks out there, shooting in the dark trying to figure out which one to choose for your next application. With so many that come to fruition, how are we suppose to know which will keep its traction through its adolescent life. There is a great site that helps you view the differences between these MV* frameworks. It’s called [TodoMVC](http://www.todomvc.com). I recommend researching what is out there. Out of all of them, Angular was the right fit for me, and for my coding style.

There are a lot of things I look for in a framework. Some key factors to me are:

* Ease of Use
* A well-documented API
* An active, strong community
* It’s backed by a known enteprise
* It’s Scalable
* It’s Extensible
* It’s Modular

Fortunately, Angular hits on all of these points. In my opinion, Angular is as native as you can get to writing HTML/Javascript with a third-party MV* framework. It has a strong, active community, and it’s backed by Google…yes, Google. You can find more information and download the framework [here](http://www.angularjs.org).
